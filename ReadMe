blue/green deployment is a zero downtime strategy
	for example if blue is running, we will create a new set of infra called green
	we do some health checks or sanity testing based on project requirement
	if green infra passed testing, we will switch routing from blue to green
	now green is running version and blue is standby version
	after few days, if any major defects found out, we can easily switch over to old version i.e blue
	this process goes on
